# Session 17&18 Poker Simulator
You are requested to fork this repo. After that, run the program and try to understad it.
Add different methods to the Hand class to check for different poker hand combinations like: 2 pairs, flush, straight and so on.  
Check this link if you are not familiar with poker hand rankings:  
[Poker Hands](https://www.cardplayer.com/rules-of-poker/hand-rankings)  

Once that is done, run a simulation of 10.000 hands and count the number of times each combinations shows up.  
For example you could have: 2000 one pair, 500 two pairs, etc.  
Do some simple statistics with that information.  

Any question please send me an email
